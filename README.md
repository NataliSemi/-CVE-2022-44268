# PNG Image Generator

This Python script generates a PNG image filled with a specific color and embeds a file path as metadata using the Pillow library.

## Running the Script

### Prerequisites
- Python (install from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/))
- Pillow library (`pip install pillow`)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NataliSemi/-CVE-2022-44268.git
   cd -CVE-2022-44268.git

2. Install Required Packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pillow

3. Run the Script:
    ```bash
    python create_image.py

Generated Image:
After running the script, an image file named image.png will be created in the repository directory.

### How script works: 

1. The multiply_bytes() function replicates the RGBA bytes (representing the color red) 40,000 times.
2. The Image.new() function creates a new RGBA image of dimensions 200x200 pixels filled with the color red.
3. The file path is taken as input from the user, and this path is added to the image metadata.
4. The image data (repeated red color) is put onto the image.
5. Finally, the image is saved as a PNG file named image.png in the current directory.
